	<div id="aboutMe">
	<div class="aboutText">My name is John Calhoun and I am currently attending the University of Michigan Dearborn. When I am not at school or work you can find me on the computer trying to make my ideas come to life. If I'm not doing that then I am enjoying time with friends, family, or looking for something active to do. Growing up I played many sports, I developed a competitive nature. Whether it was in the backyard or on the ice rink I wanted to win. The most important thing I learned from sports was that teamwork and attitude always gave you and edge on competition. I am always open-minded to try new things or learn new languages, diving straight into something new is my preferred way to learn. If you would like to learn more feel free to contact me for any reason, my email address is at the <a href="#">top of the page.</a></div>
